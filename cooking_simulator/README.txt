COOKING SIMULATOR MOD - Fausto Martinez

BASIC MOD INFO:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The object of this mod is to use Quake 4's resources to play a cooking style game. To start the game, stand on the big platform directly in front of you.
NPCs will begin to spawn in, one by one, every set amount of seconds (initially 50 seconds, eventually goes down to 20). Hover over them to see what they
want. Move around the different cooking stations and collect the ingredients by standing over the smaller platforms in front of the tables. The recipe 
stations show you how many of each item you need. Once you have the necessary ingredients give them to the appropriate NPC.


USING THE MOD SHORTCUT:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
After opening Quake 4 using the shortcut exe, open the console using "~" and type in "map test". This will bring you to the map linked to the mod.


RECIPE INFO:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Upon combining ingredients to make a recipe, you will be required to complete a small minigame. The minigame involves a GUI that displays a text, such as "RED"
, but with a color that is not depicted by the text.
      -  For example: text is "RED", color is blue.
You must click on the button that belongs to the color of the text, NOT the name of the text.
If you mess up, you will have to start from the first page of the GUI. Mess up twice and the GUI will despawn. In order to respawn it, simply stay on the 
recipe platform and it will come back.


NPC/COIN SYSTEM & UPGRADES:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Successfully giving an NPC the right order rewards you with 1 coin. Use these coins in the Upgrade GUI located in the back wall. Each upgrade show costs 3 coins.
If you do not have the proper order for the NPC, the player will lose 25 health. Mess up too often and the player will die.
Similarly, if there are ever more than 3 NPCs present at a time, the player will die.

There are a total of 5 NPCs. A random NPC will spawn after a set amount of seconds. This NPC will ask for a random order. To be more specific, each NPC has a
chance to order 1 of 5 orders. Additionally, each NPC has a higher chance to choose 1 of these orders. 
      -  For example: NPC 1 has a higher chance to ask for order #3, while NPC 2 has a higher chance to ask for order #5


TESTING PURPOSES COMMAND:
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Use "trigger give_orders" in the console to give yourself 50 of each recipe and drinks required to give to the NPCs.
